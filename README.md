# Simple Image Size Package User Guide

Amazing! This package is what i use to verify an image's width and height in a very simple step. 

> You are requiring the getImageSize() and simply pass in your image file.

> I would create a demo page to place here soon ... [Demo](https://portfolio.recash.tech/#)

## Install

Add the Package using npm 

To install, use:

```bash
npm install simple-image-size # or yarn simple-image-size
```

## Usage

First Import the package, `import getImageSize from 'simple-image-size'`
or Import the package, `const getImageSize = require('simple-image-size')`
The is an async operation so you can use async/await or then/catch to get a promise Object with the image's width and height. You can use it by passing the image file as the only parameter to `getImageSize(file)`.
